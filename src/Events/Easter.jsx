                  <h3>EASTER AT GFC!</h3>
                  <p>Jesus has risen and the same power that resurrected Him from the dead is still changing lives. This is what Easter is all about. It's celebrating Jesus bringing hope to the world. <br></br>
                      We are so excited to be celebrating Easter in person and online with 15 in-person services and two online opportunities, there is an experience for everyone. <br></br>
                      We are excited to celebrate with you through worship, prayer, studying God's word, and taking communion together. There will also be various family-friendly events at each campus such as an Easter Egg Hunt or Easter Egg Maze, Inflatable Jump Houses, Food Trucks, Games, and more.</p>
